# Mouse-Voxel-Engine

[Watch An Early Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQxjp5jqREM)

Mouse Voxel Engine is a dead simple real time voxel rendering engine I am developing.
It is not meant to be serious in any way. I work on it for fun and to practice
my graphics programming. 

In the future I intend to make a serious real time voxel
rendering engine however, but until then, this is my sandbox.

Complete Features:
- Creating and rendering arbitrary voxel models
- Realtime shadow mapping
- Ambient occlusion

Features In Development:
- Voxel Editor

Planned Features:
- Pivot from geometry shader to GPU raymarching or mesh shaders
- Smarter geometry representation
- Better materials (PBR, reflection, refraction)
- Volumetric Rendering
