# Mouse-Voxel-Engine

Mouse Voxel Engine is a dead simple real time voxel rendering engine I am developing.
It is not meant to be serious in any way. I work on it for fun and to practice
my graphics programming. 

In the future I intend to make a serious real time voxel
rendering engine however, but until then, this is my sandbox.

Complete Features:
- Creating and rendering contents of any arbitrary size voxel spaces
- Phong reflection model
- Controllable camera

Features In Development:
- Voxel Editor

Planned Features:
- Saving and loading voxel spaces from disk
- Greedy Meshing
- Ambient Occlusion
